## Twig/Timber basic WordPress blog theme build from tutorial

I built a basic bootstrapped blog theme along with a tutorial utilizing Twig and Timber. Twig is a PHP theme engine used along with Timber for WordPress creating an MVC like development environment allowing for a separation of concerns. Keeping logic and display separate.

In order to develop this project I set up a local MAMP sever with the latest version of WordPress. Used Git to manage directories, files, install dependencies including composer, Timber, Bootstrap, Laravel Mix (BrowserSync), and Node.js (with NPM).
